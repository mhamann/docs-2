# Mobile App Sign-in

### Mobile App Sign-in overview

\
Mobile app sign-in creates a golden path for mobile app download.  Instead of losing context when a user goes to download an app, in the Rownd-led flow, they sign-up, authenticate, download the app, and are automatically signed in.  The user profile data is already configured and they can start interacting with the app.&#x20;

Note: The [Rownd Mobile SDK](../../../sdk-reference/mobile/) must be installed to use this method. &#x20;
