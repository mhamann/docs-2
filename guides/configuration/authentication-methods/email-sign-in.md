# Email Sign-in

### When to use email sign-in.

Rownd email sign-in is one of the easiest ways to add authentication to a website or app.  Instead of having users create an insecure or hard-to-remember password, they simply enter their email address and verify it by clicking on a button in an email that Rownd automatically sends out.&#x20;

### Navigating to the Email Authentication  method

Toggle Email to "Allow for Authentication."  \

### Configuration

Customize your emails by selecting "Configure"

![Rownd allows customers to edit the email template and call to action for email authentication](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

**From Field:** The email will be FROM the name of your application.  [Update your application name](../applications.md#edit-an-application) to change the "from" field. \
\
**Logo:** Upload a custom logo to display in emails.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Logos must be .png of .jpg and must NOT have any special characters in the file name (ie, -, \_, $, etc)
{% endhint %}

**Email Verification Subject Line:** This is what your user will see in their inbox.  Tip is to keep it simple and straightforward forward "Verify and sign in".  \
\
**Email Verification Content:** The text in the body.  Again, keep it simple.

**Button Text:**  The actual call to action on the button. &#x20;

**From Address:**  By default, this will come from Rownd. If you want to customize the From Address, please contact Rownd Support at support@rownd.io.\
