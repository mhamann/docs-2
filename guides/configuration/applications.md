# Applications

A Rownd application contains a unique code snippet that, when injected across your product, provides user authentication to your platform. Within your Rownd application, you can define and customize authentication methods, data types, and more. You can also connect a Rownd application to your existing tools with Integrations. It is likely that one Rownd application is enough to span all aspects of your product, but you can create multiple Rownd apps in your account as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your application name is used in all verification messages used to authenticate your users. We recommend using the name of your company or product for your application name. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### **Switch to another application**&#x20;

If you have multiple Rownd applications, you can switch between them

1. Use the application dropdown in the top left corner
2. Navigate to a different application from the list of applications you have access to

Not seeing the application you're looking for?&#x20;

* Try ‘switching accounts’ in the top right dropdown menu to see if the application you are looking for is associated with a different account
* Are you signed in with the correct email? It’s possible that the application you are looking for is associated with a different email. Try signing out and signing back in with the email that might have that application on it.&#x20;

#### **Delete an application**

If you wish to delete an application, you can delete it from the overview tab.

1. In the Overview tab, click on the vertical overview menu, and select “Delete.”
2. In the modal that appears, confirm you want to delete the app by selecting “Delete app.”

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting your Rownd application completely removes all application data from Rownd. If the application is being used to authenticate users in your product, deleting will prevent all future sign ups and sign ins via Rownd.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
